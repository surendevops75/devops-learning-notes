# Jenkins Upgrade and Maintenance

## Introduction

A Jenkins server is never a "set it and forget it" application.

New releases introduce:

- Security patches
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Plugin compatibility updates
- New features

Without regular maintenance, Jenkins becomes vulnerable, unstable, and difficult to support.

A production Jenkins administrator must plan upgrades carefully to minimize downtime while ensuring compatibility.

---

# Why Upgrade Jenkins?

Imagine a Jenkins server that hasn't been updated for two years.

```text
Jenkins

↓

Old Version

↓

Outdated Plugins

↓

Security Vulnerabilities

↓

Build Failures

↓

Production Risk
```

Eventually,

- Plugins stop working.
- Security vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- Java versions become unsupported.
- New integrations fail.

---

# Why Maintenance is Important?

Even without upgrades,

Jenkins requires regular maintenance.

Examples

- Disk cleanup
- Workspace cleanup
- Plugin review
- User cleanup
- Backup verification
- JVM tuning
- Log rotation

Without maintenance,

```text

Always verify compatibility with your Jenkins version.

---

# Restart Strategies

Some upgrades require a restart.

```text
Install Plugin

↓

Safe Restart

↓

Running Builds Finish

↓

Restart Jenkins
```

Safe Restart is preferred because active builds are allowed to complete.

---

# Safe Restart

Navigate to

```text
Manage Jenkins

↓

Prepare for Shutdown
```

Behavior

```text
No New Builds

↓

Current Builds Finish

↓

Restart

↓

Ready
```

---

# Restart vs Safe Restart

| Restart | Safe Restart |
|----------|--------------|
| Immediate | Waits for builds |
| Running jobs interrupted | Running jobs complete |
| Higher risk | Recommended |

---

# Maintenance Tasks

A Jenkins administrator should perform regular maintenance.

Typical activities

- Review plugins
- Remove unused jobs
- Clean workspaces
- Archive artifacts
- Rotate logs
- Verify backups
- Review security
- Monitor resources

---

# Workspace Cleanup

Old workspaces consume disk space.

Example Pipeline

```groovy
post {
    always {
        cleanWs()
    }
}
```

Benefits

- Reduced storage
- Faster builds
- Cleaner agents

---

# Build Cleanup

Configure build retention.

Example

```text
Keep

Last 30 Builds

↓

Delete Older Builds
```

This prevents uncontrolled storage growth.

---

# Plugin Cleanup

Review plugins regularly.

```text
Installed Plugins

↓

Unused Plugins

↓

Remove

↓

Restart
```

Unused plugins

- Increase attack surface
- Consume memory
- Slow startup

---

# User Cleanup

Review inactive users.

```text
Users

↓

Inactive

↓

Disable

↓

Remove Access
```

This improves security.

---

# Credential Review

Regularly review

- Expired credentials
- Unused credentials
- Duplicate credentials
- API Tokens

Rotate sensitive credentials periodically.

---

# System Health Checks

Regularly verify

```text

# Configuration as Code (JCasC)

## What is JCasC?

Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) stores Jenkins configuration in YAML files.

Instead of configuring Jenkins manually,

everything becomes version-controlled.

---

# JCasC Architecture

```text
Git Repository

↓

JCasC YAML

↓

Jenkins Startup

↓

Configuration Applied
```

---

# Benefits of JCasC

- Version control
- Easy rollback
- Repeatable deployments
- Faster disaster recovery
- Infrastructure as Code

---

# Example

```yaml
jenkins:
  systemMessage: "Production Jenkins"
```

Instead of clicking through the UI,

configuration is stored in Git.

---

# Rolling Upgrade Strategy

Large organizations often use a staged approach.

```text
Development

↓

QA

↓

Staging

↓

Production
```

Each environment validates the upgrade before moving to the next.

---

# Rollback Strategy

Every upgrade should have a rollback plan.

```text
Upgrade

↓

Problem Found

↓

Restore Backup

↓

Rollback Version

↓

Resume Service
```

Never perform upgrades without a tested rollback procedure.
